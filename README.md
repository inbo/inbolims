# inbolims
R scripts supporting the LIMS functionality (specific for INBO - so not useful outside of the institute and its partners)
The main focus are data queries based on the data warehouse of the lab results in the INBO institute.

It accesses both the main database of the LIMS system and the data warehouse around it, and these databases are only accessible from within the institute of via the VPN of the institute.
